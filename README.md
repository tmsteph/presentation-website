# presentation-website

This will be a simple site using html, css, javascript, and three.js

The goal is to be able to present at conferences and also display online easily.

Needs to run independently as an app with no installation in the browser. 



We can even host here on github!

More on that later.. 



For now we have to create the site! 

Check back for more details later.
